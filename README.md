# SIM6502
A 6502 Simulator / Emulator that runs under MVS 3.8J (TK5)  
  
Hello Retro Computing Fans!  


If you ever wrote 6502 Assembler Code for the Apple II or the Commodore 64,  
and you are into running MVS 3.8J under Hercules, then  
you will love this 6502 Sim that I wrote that runs under our beloved   
MVS 3.8J.    
  
Please see my READMEs for Documentation.  
  
README.install is what you want to read first.  
README.io describes how I/O is done.  
README.6502ASM talks about assembling your 6502 code and the "HEXIN" file.
